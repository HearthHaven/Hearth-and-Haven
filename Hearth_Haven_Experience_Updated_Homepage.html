        <h2>Woman- and Veteran-Owned</h2>
        <p>Hearth & Haven Comforts LLC is proudly owned and operated by a woman and veteran. With a background in military service, I learned the importance of dedication, discipline, and attention to detail. These values are at the heart of everything we do.</p>
        <p>As a corporate professional and frequent traveler, I’ve experienced firsthand what it’s like to stay in accommodations that lack the essentials for comfort and convenience. From forgetting basic toiletries to missing the feeling of being at home, I realized how much of a difference thoughtful details can make.</p>
        <p>That’s why Hearth & Haven was created — to provide warm, welcoming spaces equipped with everything you need to feel truly at ease during your stay. Whether it’s a fully stocked kitchen, cozy furnishings, or the little touches that make all the difference, our goal is to ensure you feel cared for, no matter where your journey takes you.</p>
